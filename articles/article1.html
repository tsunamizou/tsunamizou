        <p> A sugar glider sneaked into my flat earlier this year, and I contacted RSPCA to rescue this little creature since I wasn't able to find its owner.
        RSPCA did an interview with me and send the article to various media outlets, including the likes of <span><a href="https://www.itv.com/news/london/2022-01-12/gliding-possum-swooped-into-shocked-londoners-bedroom-as-he-slept">ITV</a></span>and
        <a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-10394937/Londoner-finds-POSSUM-scuttling-bedroom-swooped-window-slept-Video.html">Daily Mail.</a></p>

        <p>This is the first time I've ever been on the news since I moved to London and I was surprised by the outreach of this story. Even a journalist from CBS in Canada contacted me showing interest of a possible radio interview.</p>
        <p>There were some pretty interesting or even offensive (I don't take it seriously) comments under the Daily Mail article and I've picked out a few worst rated ones from the website.</p>
        <p>- Dick Dudley: Wonder what they taste like? (40 downvotes)</p>
        <p>- Tim Eforerevolt: He should just let it go, every other species seems to thrive in London. (43 downvotes)</p>
        <p>- Ruthless London: Surprised he didn't eat the possum! (29 downvotes)</p>
        <p>- FYall: Keep this story. If it bites him you may add it to the theories about the origin of Covid (12 downvotes)</p>
        <p>Also a few best rated ones: </p>
        <p>- MysteryMike: He should just let it go, every other species seems to thrive in London. (143 upvotes)</p>
        <p>- Grumpy_Oldman: I can see why they should not be kept as pets, but it is a charming little animal. (120 upvotes)</p>
        <p>- George Roper: Poor creature, obviously got in an Uber when it was drunk. (52 upvotes)</p>
        <p>- lots-of-fakes-onsite: Good job Mr Zoe did not have a cat or it would soon have been a dead Possum. (47 upvotes)</p>
