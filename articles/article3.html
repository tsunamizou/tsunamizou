        <p>I went to Curzon Bloomsbury last night to watch the documentary Navalny telling the story of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny. I didnâ€™t know too much about him before watching the film so I was amazed by his charisma, intelligence and courage and of course deeply impressed by the work of the data journalist, especially how they worked together to call out the spies.
</p>
        <p>Sitting in the cinema, however, I couldnâ€™t help thinking how this would happen in China, or whether someone like Navalny can even appear in China at all. Sadly, I think the answer is no.</p>
        <p>When checking out the ratings of Navalny on <a href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt17041964/ratings/?ref_=tt_ov_rt">IMDB,</a>I immediately noticed something unusual - the average ratings from the 18-29 age group is 2.3/10 compared to 7.3 from 30-44 and 8.2 from 45+, resulting in an overall rating of 5.4/10 for this documentary. If broken down by US and non-US users, the difference is also obvious, 3,212 non-US users contributed to an average rating of 4.5. Itâ€™s not too difficult to lead to the conclusion that IMDB ratings have been flooded by Russian bots. As a Chinese person, I see similar things everyday on Chinese film rating sites like Douban, with all the propaganda films and tv series rated highly by bots, while the others that donâ€™t fit CCPâ€™s narrative are often seeing negative reviews. The only difference is, if Navalny were Chinese, this film wouldnâ€™t even be allowed on Douban or being discussed on Chinese social media sites.
        </p>
        <p>The similarity and differences of IMDB and Douban is a perfect example to reflect how the dictatorship and censorship in China is much worse than in Russia.</p>
        <p>Although Navalny has been tragically arrested by the Russian government in the end, the fact that he has already got over 6 million subscribers on YouTube is something unthinkable in China. First of all, YouTube is banned in China and people need to use VPN to access it; Secondly, if someone sets up social media accounts on Chinese sites like Weibo, WeChat or Bilibili, he/she will immediately get censored once the anti-government content become widespread on the Internet; Last but not least, even private group chats on messaging apps like WeChat will get dismissed if all you do is criticising the government or planning protests. </p>
      <p>In the Internet age, it is just impossible for an opposition leader in China to gain influence like how Navalny did. He would get arrested within a month and probably no one will ever get to know him, not to mention gathering on the streets or airport to show him support. Iâ€™m actually surprised that Russia can allow him to freely and publicly promote his ideas, which means the human rights situation there is still much better than in China.
</p>
        <p>Of course there are some similarities between Russia and China propaganda, like how the state media defamed Navalny and labeled the anti-corruption team as extremists, how Putin blamed the CIA behind all this, which is too familiar for Chinese people. However, at least Putin has given the permission to the journalists to ask anything they want, and he actually answered them, which is something Xi Jinping will never have the gut or capability to do.</p>
        <p>This is why I see no hope in democracy for China after watching Navalny. The political system and society is dead, no one will stand up for the people and nor do most of the people care, they just want to get on with their lives, even if only enjoying very limited freedom. They are afraid of the government and the CCP machine who simply has too much control on everyone living in this country.</p>
        <p>Some of my friends are saying the turning point can only appear when China starts war with Taiwan or when Chinaâ€™s economy collapses. I only hope I can witness a change of the Chinese government in my lifetime. Letâ€™s wait and see.</p>
