        <p>It's such a shame that I only found out about Curzon Bloomsbury after being in London for more than four years. Curzon Bloomsbury has this 56-seat cinema
        called Bertha Dochouse that is dedicated to showing high-quality documentaries around the world. After buying tickets for Navalny which I plan to watch on Sunday, I browsed
        through their other films and was glad that they are showing Revolution Of Our Times.</p>
        <p>When this Hong Kong documentary was first released in London a few weeks ago, almost all the cinemas were sold out. I gathered that most of the Hongkongers in London
          must have already watched this film by now. I couldn't really tell how many of them in the cinema today are from Hong Kong, but no one applauded or chanted HK slogans when the film ended, which reportedly happened a lot in the earlier screenings.
          Nonetheless, as a Chinese person originally from the mainland, I have much respect for the audience sitting around me, knowing that at least they all care about freedom and justice. </p>
        <p>As for the documentary itself, it seems a bit tedious without a very clear storyline, and is more like a montage of chronicle events. However, I was impressed by the sentiment in the ending that emphasized the importance of Hongkongers than the land
        which is now more and more controlled by the Chinese government. The exiled Hongkongers are compared to the Jews, with the hope that they might be able to establish their own country eventually, which I think is just too optimistic and makes me feel sad and helpless.
        When talking about revolution, what exactly do Hong Kong people want to achieve? Surely there's already no turning back and the only way out is when the CCP collapses. But when you are not even in Hong Kong or mainland China, how can you topple the regime?
        </p>
        <p> This is not something that Hong Kong people can accomplish by themselves. They are seeking help from the US, the UK and other democratic countries, but I believe they need the most help from the Chinese people, who are the closest to the party and
          have more and more of them starting to feel rebellious. Right now in Shanghai, for example, the CCP is using pandemic control as an excuse to enforce ridiculous restrictions on ordinary people,
        resulting in shortage of food and medical resources, even causing deaths including suicides. Although the majority of Chinese people are still only caring about themsleves, there is certainly a growing number of people who have become able to relate to the Hongkongers and ciriticise the government.
        These are the people that Hongkongers should unite! I always feel that many non-mainland Chinese people want to distance themselves from the mainlanders, considering them as being brainwashed by the CCP. 
          But the truth is, even if they are brainwashed, they are also the victims who need to be saved and educated by the outside world rather than being further isolated. No one do not deserve human rights. As much as I despise the government, the least thing I want to see is the western society 
          turning this "China hate" into racism, which could really affect other east Asian people, especially Chinese people outside China, including Hongkongers and Taiwanese.</p>
        <p> We are now previledged to live in a free world and we could just enjoy our lives without caring about the country we come from. If we are to start a real revolution of our times, however, we must help each other and most importantly 
          help everyone who is suffering from the dictatorship. Mainlanders living abroad are the perfect bridge that connect Hongkongers with the people inside China and I hope I can get to know more Hongkongers in London and around the world, to join this revolution together, to save Hong Kong, and to save China as well.</p>
